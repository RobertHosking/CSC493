# Payvr ERC20 Token (YAP)

This repo contains the Ethereum smart contract that produces the tokens for Payvr.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To trade ERC20 Tokens, you will need a Ether wallet that is ERC20 compatible.

We reccommend [Trust Wallet](https://trustwalletapp.com/) for iOS and Android.

To deploy this smart contract yourself, follow [this guide](https://medium.com/mercuryprotocol/dev-highlights-of-this-week-cb33e58c745f)
You will need to install the Go-Ethereum (Geth) framework and sync the Ethereum blockchain.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
